# OXY3N STUDIO DISABLE PVP SCRIPT

Consum: 0.00ms - 0.08ms

Today we present a script that will allow you to deactivate some keys which will block the PVP
To change the window safely, so that we do not make an involuntary blow when returning the game in the case of having people around.

This mod is recommended for Roleplay since we will avoid missclicks that can bother the role.

You can assign a key to activate it faster.
```
    ["ESC"], ["F1"], ["F2"], ["F3"], ["F5"], ["F6"], ["F7"], ["F8"], ["F9"], ["F10"], 
    ["~"], ["1"], ["2"], ["3"], ["4"], ["5"], ["6"], ["7"], ["8"], ["9"], ["-"], ["="], ["BACKSPACE"],
    ["TAB"],   ["Q"], ["W"], ["E"], ["R"], ["T"], ["Y"], ["U"], ["P"], ["["], ["]"], ["ENTER"], 
    ["CAPS"], ["A"], ["S"], [ "D"], ["F"], ["G"], ["H"], ["K"], ["L"], 
    ["LEFTSHIFT"], ["Z"], ["X"], ["C"], ["V"], ["B"], ["N"], ["M"], [","], ["."], 
    ["LEFTCTRL"], ["LEFTALT"], ["SPACE"], ["RIGHTCTRL"], 

    ["HOME"], ["PAGEUP"], ["PAGEDOWN"], ["DELETE"],
    ["LEFT"], ["RIGHT"], ["TOP"], ["DOWN"],
    ["NENTER"], ["N4"], ["N5"], ["N6"], ["N+"], ["N-"], ["N7"], ["N8"], ["N9"]
```

We also leave a list of the predefined keys that we have blocked.

```
    24 = "Attack"
    25 = "Aim"
    257 = "Attack 2"
    263 = "Melee Attack 1"
```
